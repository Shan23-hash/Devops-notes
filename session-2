What is computer?
==================
IP enabled device

In Linux, "computer" refers to the physical machine, or hardware, that runs the operating system. Linux itself is a software operating system (OS) that manages the hardware and software on a computer. The kernel, which is a core part of Linux, acts as the intermediary between the hardware and other software, allowing them to interact.

laptop == mobile == server == chip == tv ==> computer
server ==> only to host applications

RAM, OS, HD, Processor --> IP enabled device

Client Server architecture

Client-server architecture is a network model where clients request services from one or more servers. The server then processes these requests and provides the requested resources or services back to the client. This architecture is fundamental to many modern applications, including web browsing, email, and online banking.

Networking between computers

1. Network
2. Facebook application

serve --> lawyer serves to us, we are his client
ex : server : TCS
       client – HDFC,SBI etc…..

Facebook is in Linux server, if problem comes we need to login to server..

Windows:

Protocol: https
Port: 443
IP: DNS IP
Username and password --> authentication


Linux:

SSH --> secure shell
Port: 22
IP, Username and password/private-key

Firewall --> checks inbound and outbound traffic

inbound --> incoming traffic --> port number 22, 103.149.59.114
outbound --> outgoing traffic

authentication
==================
1. what you know --> username password
2. what you have --> keys, tokens, authentication, rsa token
3. what you are --> fingerprint, retina, palm, face

Server == box == node

lock = public
key = private

key pairs --> public key and private key


1. create key pair
2. create firewall
3. import public key to aws account
4. create server and attach public key
5. attach firewall to server

Git Bash --> Mini Linux in windows
SSH client

browser --> http/https client
Linux Server --> SSH Server

git bash == putty == super putty == mobaxterm == mac terminal = windows cmd

ssh clients

pwd --> present working directory

User Directory
C:\Users\siva --> windows format
/c/Users/siva --> linux format

windows --> not case sensitive Siva == siva == Siva  All are same
Linux --> case sensitive --> Siva != siva no space in linux

/c/devops/daws-84s == C:\devops\daws-84s

ssh-keygen -f <file-name>

ssh-keygen -f daws-84s

ssh-rsa long-random-code 

Region --> us-east-1

Anywhere : 0.0.0.0/0 (add rule in aws)

98.81.70.98, 22, SSH, ec2-user, private-key
   Ip,port,ptotocol and key
ssh -i <private-key> ec2-user@98.81.70.98

OS --> Redhat, Ubuntu, centos, fedore, suse, oracle linux, amazon linux, debian, rocky linux, kali, solaris

Linux is os or not --> Linux is kernel

OS --> to interact with hardware

Kernal --> heart and brain of OS

Kernel + UI == OS

Redhat --> kernel + user interface ==> Redhat OS
Debian --> Linux kernel + UI ==> Debian

99.9% same all Linux distros/flavours

Redhat --> Open source --> code is free
Redhat enterprise RHEL --> support

RHEL = AWS Linux = Centos = Fedora = Rocky Linux = AlmaLinux

command <options> <inputs>

uname – linux(kernel)
uname –a = all
uname --help  get to know all the information
uname –n  node name
uname –p __. Processor

/home/ec2-user --> linux home directory
/c/users/siva --> windows home directory

cd --> change directory

cd .. --> one step back

ls --> list subdirectories
ls -l --> long list
